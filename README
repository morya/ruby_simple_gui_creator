This lib is meant to simplify some common GUI tasks, like:

# select file or filename for a "new file" (not yet existing)
SwingHelpers.new_nonexisting_filechooser_and_go 
SwingHelpers.new_existing_dir_chooser_and_go # select pre-existing directory
SwingHelpers.show_in_explorer(filename) # reveals file in Finder for windows, OS X
SwingHelpers.show_blocking_message_dialog "a message to display"
from_user = SwingHelpers.get_user_input "tell me your name"

A select-button prompt:

if(SwingHelpers.show_select_buttons_prompt("message title", :yes => 'text for the yes button', :no => 'text for the no button', :cancel => 'text for the cancel button') == :yes)
  # they chose the "yes" equivalent button
end

etc.

It adds a few methods to the JFrame class, like:

JFrame#bring_to_front
JFrame#minimize

It has helpers to control/playback audio, like mp3's or wave's, starting/stopping asynchronously.

It has helpers to set/get the system clipboard contents.

It has helpers to control/query the mouse (I use this, but don't know why anybody else ever would want to LOL).

It has helpers to query the current system for its DVD drives, be notified when disks are inserted/changed, etc.

Enjoy!
