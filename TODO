see spec/parse_template.spec.rb for another (the real) TODO list

revamp GUI (add drop down, better demo template), re-release, release on ruby flow LOL.

= maybe =

 # LODO allow internal sub-boxes LOL
 # LODO should pass the button through to on_clicked [?] or button with frame, too?
 # LODO should be able to clear everything a button does or used to do...
 # LODO a 'title managing' object LOL
 # LODO rel_width=+100 or some odd
 # LODO real documentation LOL
 # buttons should require a code name :P

if the window goes too low, they can't see it all, and it doesn't scroll?


use native file handlers, the swing ones shuck with default save filenames

= never =

HTML linked version. what the woot! LOL.
  serialize the object...to RAM for now LOL.
  pull the object from a db based on ID
  instance_exec the [saved in RAM] proc
    this would mean you can never "wildly redefine" action for pages though clicks...hmm...
	or you could just pass "self" through...hmm...
	whatever would be first pass ideal, just make that happen
  
fix: Parsing failed on line "      _                       _\t  \n" number: 5!
